<h1>Introduction</h1>
I worked as a design and principle lead for the USEP project and l researched on design as a process and design as an artifact for the USEP project. I discovered that design in 2025 is no longer a step-by-step process .it is now a faster process with iterative and user centered process.
Findings
Design as a Principle
For the USEP project, l discovered that l could take design as a process whereby we gather requirements from the students as well as the institution for example multilingual support. After that , l can create high level architecture where l define how components such as microservices and serverless are going to interact with the USEP.I also researched on the diagrams l was going to use. For example, diagrams like interactive prototypes found out that after choosing the diagrams used for the USEP, we had to consider how the system was going to scale to an increasing number of students.
Design as an Artifact
I discovered that l could take design as an artifact where l could provide tangible outputs for the USEP to act as a communication tool between developers and stakeholders. I concluded that the relevant artifacts for the USEP is UML use case, which shows how the students would interact with the centralized platform. The use case showed that the user can do services such as registration of courses, view timetable, track financial aid. Another artifact to implement for the USEP is the ADR.
Modern design trends0
I researched on the modern design trends that could be implemented for the USEP system. Among the design trends, l found out that micro service architecture application, AI assisted design as well as Serverless and Cloud-Native functions application would be the best considering the project we are doing. I looked at the reasons of implementing these design trends. For example, serverless and cloud native functions application scales well to an increasing number of students enrolled at the institution and students can access services any time.
Principles First vs Application First
I researched on these two approaches and the results of each considering the USEP system. I discovered the potential danger of using the application first, whereby we build the USEP prototype and refine principles later. The danger with this approach that l discovered was that it could ignore inclusivity and ethics. 
Principles in Practice, l discovered is sustainable and is less risky considering we have a budget constraint. It is also best as it starts from theory to implementation .It also corresponds well to the standards lReflection-Business Analyst
Introduction
As a team, we dived into the USEP but my role was to be a business analyst, where l developed a business case for the USEP project. I carried out a research on outsourcing approach looking at the tradeoffs and disadvantages of each outsourcing approach. I also did a research on which outsourcing approach was best to implement for the Unified Student Experience Platform. My role was also to understand why the USEP was supposed to be built and what problem was is solving
Key Learning Outcomes
Outsourcing Models 
I learnt about different outsourcing approaches and factors to be considered when choosing an outsourcing approach. We have factors like project complexity, law regulations as well as communication needs. I also learnt of different outsourcing approach as onshore, offshore and nearshore otsourcing.I understood that the outsourcing approach was to be chosen based on the budget that the company had. For example, the company had a budget constraint so offshore outsourcing would be the best because labour costs are cheaper as well as we needed to take into consideration the issue of cultures and language as the platform is intended to cater for international students. I also looked at the cons of each outsourcing approach .For example; the issue of different time zones and languages was a challenge.
Business Case
I found out the key problems that not only students were facing but also the institution was facing because of having different platforms. I discovered that there were many problems that came up about on having too many platforms .For example, higher cost incurred by the school as each system had its own mantainance.I discovered that students could not keep up with important information and schedules because of having too many platforms looked at the benefits of having a centralized platform such as more engagement by students, reduced cost like maintenance cost for the school and track keeping of deadlines by students.
Conclusion
Outsourcing approach is influenced by various factors for example budget constraints and needs of the users.


<h1>Reflection-Culture and Ops Lead</h1>   
<h2>Introduction</h2>  
I did a research on cultural intelligence, DevOps and AI ethics. I looked on how we were implementing these for the USEP .My assigned role was to make sure that the system work inclusively for diverse students since we had to keep in mind that the system is supposed to be made  to meet the needs of international students as well.
Learning Outcomes
<h3>Cultural Intelligence Requirements</h3>
I learnt that the USEP was supposed to be in alignment with inclusivity. I learnt that the system was supposed to serve international students with diverse backgrounds and this meant providing multilingual support .For example, multilingual support for local language like Bemba as well multilingual support for global languages like English, French in order to meet students’ needs. I also found out about accessibility features like screen reader compability, high contrast modes and adjustable text size to cater for students with disabilities.
<h3>AI and Ethics Implementation</h3>
I learnt about the advantages  of AI would be of benefit if we were to implement it for the USEP.For example how an AI driven platform can help students plan courses, remind students of deadlines like course registration .I also discovered that an AI driven platform can help track applications and alerts on loan repayments. I also looked at the disadvantages of an AI driven platform. For example, the issue of misuse of student data as well as biasness of AI.
<h3>DevOps and DevSecOps</h3>
I came up with the CI/CD pipeline for the USEP and l looked at the benefits of such a pipeline. The pipeline was such that we have to code and from coding, we move on to building the system. After building is done, testing and security scan followed consecutively followed by deploying and monitoring of the system. I looked on the advantages of such a pipeline. Examples include faster and reliable updates, less security vulnerabilities and scaling.
